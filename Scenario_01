Scenario 1:

SSH into node01
Check the kubelet service
Restart it to bring the node back online
------------------------------------------
Solution:
kubectl get all ---> list of cluster
kubectl get nodes --> list of nodes
ssh <node name> --> ssh node01
systemctl status kubelet ---> (to check the status of the kubelet whether active or deactivated)
(or)
sudo systemctl status kubelet -n 20


sudo systemctl stop kubelet  --> stops the kubelet
sudo systemctl start kubelet  --> starts the kubelet service
sudo systemctl restart kubelet ---> restarts the kubelet service
sudo systemctl enable kubelet


Note: systemctl is a Linux command used to control and manage systemd services.

Think of it like this:
On Linux, programs that run in the background (like kubelet, nginx, sshd, etc.) are called services (daemons).
systemd is the system manager that starts, stops, and monitors those services.
systemctl is the tool you use to talk to systemd.
